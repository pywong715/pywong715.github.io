                <p>Inspired by the Japanese single bookstore, Morioka Shoten Ginza, the founder of Jat1 Pui4 Books incorporated the concept of "A Single Room, A Single Book" into their local practice. </p>
                <p>Jat1 Pui4 turns the books they sell into exhibitions, providing readers with the opportunity to immerse themselves in the book and create their own unique reading experiences. The current exhibition, which is focused on Wei-jing Lee's <em>The Necessary of Old-Fashioned Dating</em>, is curated in the bookstore, and features a walking date based on the book for readers to participate in. </p>

                <p>Traces of Books is a self-funded library run by social worker Map Tang. Upon entering, visitors will find a cozy space with two walls of books and cushions on the wooden floor. Despite the lack of financial resources and employees, the library offers free access to its collection. Visitors are encouraged to explore on their own, as there are no librarians, check-out services, or catalogues.</p>
                <p>However, Tang showcases her weekly favorite books on top of the bookshelf by the entrance as starting points for regulars, affectionately referred to as "tracers," to begin their reading journeys.</p>

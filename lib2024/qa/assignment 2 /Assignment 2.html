            Jat1 Pui4 Books, an independent bookstore in Hong Kong, stocks only one book each month. The concept of encountering only one book at a time is embedded in the name of the bookstore, which is extracted from a classic novel Dream of the Red Chamber. This sentence is a love confession from that novel, which could be translated as  &#8220;you are the only one for me in this multifarious world&#8221;. Also, the store owners named their cat after the female protagonist of the novel, Baochai, which seems to be a romantic statement to the space they treasure and the cat they love. 
        <br>
     <br>
            Selling only one book seems to be an adventurous and risky retail practice; however, this tactic has been proven effective by the owner of another Japanese single bookstore, Morioka Shoten Ginza. In fact, the owners of Jat1 Pui4 are inspired by this Japanese bookstore, and adopted the concept of &#8220;A Single Room, A Single Book&#8221; into local practice. Like Morioka Shoten Ginza, Jat1 Pui4 focuses on creating a meaningful and enjoyable reading experience. Both bookstores run several events that are related to the books that they are selling, such as author talks, film screenings and book clubs. However, different from Morioka Shoten Ginza, the targeted consumers of Jat1 Pui4 are not bibliophiles, but struggling readers, which leads to a varied approach in book selection and retail operation.

            To attract struggling readers, Jat1 Pui4 turned the book they sold into an exhibition, offering readers a chance to fully embrace the book and create their own unique reading experiences. The previous exhibition was based on a collection of prose named Lunarian, which is composed by a local Instagram writer, Taylor Lee. During the exhibition, readers not only got a chance to flip through the pages, but also to see Lee&#39;s daily items &#8212; ranging from her schedule books, letters, perfumes and even her anti-depressant pills. While they were discovering the space, they unlocked the private life of the author and observed how these lively experiences turned into literary creation. This engaging reading experience might transform reluctant readers.

     <br>
            Despite having profit loss, the owners remain passionate about making the community a better place. Their enthusiasm is contagious, and has even extended to assembling regular customers to volunteer in designing and setting up exhibitions. With the support of these loyal readers, this bookstore is able to continue to serve the community with limited resources. 
        <br>
     <br>
            This bookstore is more than a love statement to literary works. It is also a community that connects people with the joy of reading. Devoting themselves into a business full of uncertainty, the owners of this bookstore put the two layers of Jat1 Pui4 into practice.

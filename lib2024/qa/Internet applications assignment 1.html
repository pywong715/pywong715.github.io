    <h2>Inspiring quotes from the movie:</h2>
    <ul>
     <p>&#10077<i> Why are we afraid of the first time? Every day in life is a first time. Every morning is new. <br>
         We never live the same day twice. We're never afraid of getting up every morning. Why? </i>&#10078; - Ota</p>

     <p>&#10077<i> I had chance to relive part of my youth. My first thought was then I could make things turnout differently but<br>
        they turned out the same or not much different. I suddenly realized that even if I was given a second chance I wouldn't need it,<br>
        I really wouldn't. </i>&#10078; - N.J.</p>
                
     <p>&#10077<i> Life is a mixture of happy and sad things. Movies are so lifelike - that's why we love them. </i>&#10078; - Pangzi</p>

				In the corner of Fu Lee Loy shopping center, a dilapidated, old-style commercial mall, there is a private library for everyone. This library seems like an oasis in Hong Kong, a city which is described as cultural desert. When you open the green door of Traces of Books, you will see a tiny and welcoming space with two walls of books and cushions placed on the wooden floor.
			</p>
			<p>
				Different from bookstores and public libraries, Tracks of Books is a self-funded space that provides free access to its collection to all visitors. Creating a non-profit public space in one of the most expensive cities for renters seems idealistic and impractical. However, Map Tang, who is the owner and a social worker, believes that a library is not a luxury but a necessity of life. That&#39;s why she funds and sustains this cozy and tranquil space with her savings.
			</p>
			<blockquote>A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life.</blockquote>
			<p>
				Without financial resources and employees, Tang leaves the door open and allows visitors to explore the library on their own during her workdays. Even though there are no librarians, check-out services or book catalogues, Tang displays her weekly favorites on top of the bookshelf next to the entrance. The recommended books serve as starting points for regulars- commonly referred to as tracers- to start their journey.
			</p>
			<p>
				Reading is a voyage to the external world, as well as an internal journey for readers to have deep conversations with themselves. During the exploration of life, there are always moments that are filled with frustration, loss, and pain. Books can be remedies and cures for loneliness, grief, and unspoken emotions. Tang believes in the healing power of reading, and that the right book at the right moment can call to the right person. Without cataloguing and shelving books in a systemic manner, Tang leaves tracers the possibility of encountering perfect books that speak to them. While navigating the collections in a random and causal setting, visitors open themselves to unexpected reading adventures. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Operating a private library without any written policies and guidelines is innovative. Instead of establishing a well-structed acquisition policy, Map develops the collection from book donations. The collection is an ensemble of titles from tracers, and this private library is like an extension of individuals&#39; homes. This strategy creates an intimate and comforting atmosphere in this bedroom library, making it a safe space for self-discovery.
			</p>
			<p>
				Traces of Books is more than books. In this home setting, visitors can temporarily detach from real life and nourish their souls.
